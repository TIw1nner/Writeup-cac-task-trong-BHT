# Exercises from 1 to 10
## Overall review:
Most of the exercises were easy to handle. However, there were two exercises which I had a a very hard time solving, "Tam Giac" and "Xep Cho Ngoi". I did manage to solve them in time but a lot of efforts were made for that to happen.
## [Ex.01 - "Xep Gach":](Code-Files/01-XepGach.cpp)
### Problem:
Patu and Motu work at a construction site, they have to move **N** number of bricks to a different place. They decide to play a game to see who will be the one to move the last brick. They base on a simple rule: at turn **i**, when Patlu moves **i** number of bricks, Motu has to move **twice** that number. They have a total of N bricks, you need to help them find out the one who will move the last brick.

Restraint: 1 <= N <= 10000
### My solution:
